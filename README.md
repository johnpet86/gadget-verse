🛍️ GadgetVerse — The Web3 Phone Accessories Marketplace

GadgetVerse is a decentralized e-commerce platform built on Hedera Hashgraph, designed exclusively for buying and selling phone accessories.
It combines the simplicity of online shopping with the power of Web3 — enabling secure payments, NFT-based receipts, and smart contract automation using Hedera and HashPack Wallet.

🚀 Project Overview

GadgetVerse redefines how users purchase phone accessories by introducing blockchain-powered transparency and tokenized ownership.
Every transaction is recorded on-chain, and every purchase generates a unique NFT receipt stored on Hedera for immutable proof of purchase.

💎 Core Features
🛒 1. Decentralized Marketplace

Explore a curated list of phone accessories (chargers, earphones, phone cases, power banks, etc.).

Products are minted as HTS tokens representing their authenticity and stock units.

Browse, filter, and add items to cart with Web3-enabled precision.

💰 2. Smart Contract Payments

Buyers complete payments using HashPack Wallet.

Payments trigger Hedera Smart Contracts, which securely handle:

Token transfers between buyer and seller

Automated escrow logic

Transaction confirmation

🎟️ 3. NFT Purchase Receipts

Each purchase automatically mints an NFT receipt via Hedera Token Service (HTS).

NFT metadata includes:

Product Name and ID

Buyer and Seller Wallet Addresses

Price and Timestamp

Transaction Hash (for on-chain verification)

🔎 4. Real-Time Transparency

Integrated with Mirror Node API to display:

Transaction histories

NFT receipts

Order verification data

Delivery confirmation on-chain

👩‍💻 5. Seller/Admin Dashboard

Sellers can:

List new products

Update stock levels

View live orders and transaction data via Mirror Node integration

🔐 6. User Authentication

Users can register via email or connect their HashPack Wallet.

Authentication and transaction signing are managed entirely through Web3 wallets — no middlemen.
